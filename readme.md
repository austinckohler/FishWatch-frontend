## FishWatch - Find a Fish! 

Find a Fish is a web application that allows users to browse saltwater fish species based on their name and picture. 

Users do have the ability to search or filter fish and click on each fish that will navigate the user to a "show page" that will provide addtional information about the fish such as the species habitat or what part of the vast ocean the fish is typically located. 

Additionally, users do have the ability to add a new species of fish. To sucessfully add the fish our users will need to enter its name, scientific name, location, habitat, and an image URL. 

The free and public API we utilized, https://www.fishwatch.gov/api/species, has a massive amount of information about each species. For simplicity we sorted down the characteristics we felt were important for our users to know. 

This project was created by students from The Flatiron School - Denver for Module 2 of the Immersive Software Engineering Program.
